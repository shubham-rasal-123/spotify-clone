### Description

This project is a Spotify-inspired music streaming interface built with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). It mimics the look and feel of Spotifyâ€™s design, featuring a sleek and responsive layout with a sidebar menu, album covers, and a player interface. Users can play, pause, and switch between tracks, with JavaScript managing basic playback controls and animations for a smooth user experience. This project is great for practicing front-end skills, including layout structuring, responsive design, and JavaScript functionality for a dynamic and interactive interface.
